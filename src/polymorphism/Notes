Polymorphism Notes:-

Types of Polymorphism:-

1) Compile time / Static Polymorphism

Achieved via method overloading.

parameter, return type are differnet but same names. 

ex -: multiple constructor of a class.

2) Runtime time / Dynamic Polymorphism

Achieved via method overriding.

parameter and return type is same but body is different.

if type is parent class and reference is subclass.
Parent obj = new Child()

which method will be called Child class , this is known as UPCASTING.

How does JAVA know which method to run ?

Dynamic method dispatch (a call to an overridden method is decided at runtime rather than compile time)

A super class refernce variable can refer to a subclass object 

Early and Late Binding

Whenever a class is final all methods and varibles become final too.

Static methods cannot be overridden.

Static doesnot depends on objects but overriding depends on objects , so static methods cannot be overridden.
