Notes Oops:- 

What is being accessed depends on the reference type not the object type.

Inheritance:-

parent ob = new Child()

ob can access only those things that are declared in parent as it of reference type parent

Child ob = new Parent() // not allowed 
As ob is type of Parent class and the reference type is child class which will not be allowed to call the constructor 
of the parent.

Super keyword (2 use cases):-
1) whenever a subclass needs to refer to super class from which it is derived.
2) if we want to access any variable from parent class.

Multiple Inheritance:-
Java Does not support as if two or more classes have same property java is unable to decide which to use.
