Notes :-

Package 
   
Packages are containers for classes.   

Static 

static variables doesnot belong to the object they belong to the class template. 

Something which is not static belongs to an object.

A static member can only access static data.

We put something in static block if we want it to run only for the first time when the class loads in the memory.

Static are resolved during compile time.

Singleton Class
make the contructor private . This will ensure that no one else can create an object for the class.
