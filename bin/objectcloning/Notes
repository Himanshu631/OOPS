Object Cloning Notes :

Done via Cloneable interface 

must specify throws CloneNotSupported

implements Clonable :- used to tell jvm that you are allowed to create clone of these objects.

Shallow Copy :- primitive data types would be copied as it is but the refernce varibales will point to the same object.

Deep Copy : makes copy for everything
